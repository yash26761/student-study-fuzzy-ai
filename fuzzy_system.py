"""
fuzzy_system.py
================
A genuine Mamdani-style Fuzzy Inference System, implemented from scratch
using plain Python + NumPy (NO external fuzzy-logic library).

This module performs the five classic steps of fuzzy inference:
    1. Fuzzification            -> convert crisp inputs into membership degrees
    2. Rule Evaluation (AND)    -> minimum operator on rule antecedents
    3. Implication              -> clip each output membership by firing strength
    4. Aggregation (OR)         -> maximum operator across all rules per output
    5. Defuzzification          -> centroid (center of gravity) method

Inputs:
    - days_until_exam   (0-30 days)
    - study_hours_today (0-12 hours)
    - preparation_level (0-100 %)

Outputs:
    - recommended_study_time (0-8 hours/day)
    - study_need             (0-100, interpreted as Low/Medium/High)

Everything here is plain, readable Python for clear interpretability and
mathematical verification.
